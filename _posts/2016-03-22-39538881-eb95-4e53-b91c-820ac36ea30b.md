"Concrete Saplings" is
a new collaboration in development by
Grammy Award-winning Chican@ folk/rock band Quetzal, and LA's taiko drumming powerhouse TAIKOPROJECT. Drawing from their shared
histories in Los Angeles and exploring points of cultural and creative
intersection, "Concrete Saplings" will be a full-length concert
production with multi-media projection and storytelling.  The show debuts in Summer 2016 at the Ford Theatres in Hollywood, California.
